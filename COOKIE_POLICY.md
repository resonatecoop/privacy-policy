# Cookie Policy

## Cookies

Our Privacy Policy explains our principles when it comes to the collection, processing, and storage of your information. This policy specifically explains how we deploy cookies, as well as the options you have to control them.

## What are cookies?

Cookies are small pieces of data, stored in text files, that are stored on your computer or other device when websites are loaded in a browser. They are widely used to 'remember' you and your preferences, either for a single visit (through a 'session cookie') or for multiple repeat visits (using a 'persistent cookie'). They ensure a consistent and efficient experience for visitors, and perform essential functions such as allowing users to register and remain logged in. Cookies may be set by the site that you are visiting (known as 'first party cookies'), or by third parties, such as those who serve content or provide advertising or analytics services on the website ('third party cookies').

## Cookies set by resonate.is

We use cookies for a number of different purposes. All cookies are necessary for technical reasons and some enable a personalized experience for both visitors and registered users. Some of these cookies may be set when a page is loaded, or when a visitor takes a particular action (clicking the 'like' or 'follow' button on a post, for example).

Below we have some details about the different types of cookies set by resonate.is. Certain cookies are only set for logged in visitors, whereas others are set for any visitor, and these are marked below accordingly.

## Analytics

We use Matomo (formerly Piwik) for internal analytics, such as tracking page views and traffic throughout the site. Matomo is similar in functionality to Google Analytics. But while Google stores and analyzes data, giving them the ability to track users across the entire internet, with Matomo, this data is strictly gathered and stored on our own servers.

This analytics data is strictly used to analyze trends and interest on the site and is never processed on an individual level, meaning we don't use our cookies to track a member's specific journey through our sites. Additionally, Resonate will never share this data with third parties unless specifically approved by a majority of the membership.

## Technical details

Beyond analytics, we only use an important cookie called a 'token' which is stored securely and is only sent over http, so it is not accessible by javascript. Other cookies used are the PHPSESSID which is set by the php api by default for basic session handling. Another one is set to detect our cookie policy approval settings 'cookieconsent_status'.
